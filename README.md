# Simple Database

This is just a simple vaguely redis-like database thingamabob.  It's a work in progress. All the data is stored as key value pairs.  You can save new things to the database, change values in the database, retrieve values, start new transaction blocks, and either rollback or commit changes.  Someday the code may be less repetative.
